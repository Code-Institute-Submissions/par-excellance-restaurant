# Par Excellance - Allergen-free Fine Dining Restaurant

Code Institute - Milestone Project 1

This project is a one-page website for an allergen-free fine dining restaurant in London. The purpose of this website is to put emphasis on the uniqueness of the restaurant's concept on the market - while making sure the website is as informative and as functional as possible to the potential customers visiting the page.
 
 
## UX
 
With the rise of autoimmune health issues which are closely connected to diet and lifestyle, the main problem this project is trying to solve is to provide a safe environment for people dealing with autoimmune disorders, allergies and food intolerances. Today we know as a fact that, for example, gluten can cause problems to certain individuals for up to 6 months after the ingestion. This is why the possibility of eating a dish from a kitchen where allergens are handled is a high risk for a great number of people. As a consequence, people with autoimmune disorders stay away from eating out which makes their social, private and business life more difficult while simultaneously, restaurant owners are loosing valuable customers who are ready to spend more to dine out.
A restaurant of such type requires a website covering user stories from two sides - the owner's perspective (business goals) and user's perspective (customer goals).

### Business goals

* As a restaurant owner, I want customers to know Iâ€™m unique on the market so that they can easily differentiate me from competitors
* As a restaurant owner, I want customers to book tables online so that my service staff saves time and efforts answering phone calls
* As a restaurant owner, I want customers to get updates about my restaurant so that they stay informed about the latest news and events

### Customer goals
* As a customer, I want to read the menu so that I can see if the food fits my diet and lifestyle
* As a customer, I want to know the prices so that I can see if the restaurant's offer fits my budget
* As a customer, I want to see ratings and reviews of the restaurant so that I can see what other customers think about the restaurant
* As a customer, I want to book a table online so that I can save time by not calling the restaurant or going there in person
* As a customer, I want to contact the restaurant easily so that I can ask if I have additional questions or give my feedback
* As a customer, I want to know when the restaurant is open and where is it so that I can make plans for a visit in advance


## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
